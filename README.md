This project deals with the matter of identifying the currency if the given sample of currency is fake. In the advanced age of Computer science and high computational methods, various machine learning algorithms are proposed by image processing that gives 99.9% accuracy for the fake identity of the currency. Detection and recognition methods over the algorithms include entities like colour, shape, paper width, image filtering on the note. In this, the banknote authentication dataset has been created with high computational and mathematical strategies, which give the correct data and information regarding the entities and features related to the currency.
